However, the design of successful model architecture has always relied on human experience and intuition. Besides, many hyperparameters related to model architecture need to be manually tuned. Therefore in this paper, we propose an ASR approach with efficient gradient-based architecture search, DARTS-ASR. In order to examine the generalizability of DARTS-ASR, we apply our approach not only on many languages to perform monolingual ASR, but also on a multilingual ASR setting. Following previous works, we conducted experiments on a multilingual dataset, IARPA BABEL. The experiment results show that our approach outperformed the baseline fixed-topology architecture by 10.2% and 10.0% relative reduction on character error rates under monolingual and multilingual ASR settings respectively. Furthermore, we perform some analysis on the searched architectures by DARTS-ASR.","tags":["Architecture Search","Seq2Seq","Multilingual"],"title":"DARTS-ASR: Differentiable Architecture Search for Multilingual Speech Recognition and Adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jui-Yang Hsu","Yuan-Jui Chen","Hung-Yi Lee"],"categories":["Speech"],"content":"","date":1588572097,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624693959,"objectID":"4e9941bc617b4417e69ea1fc91d6211b","permalink":"https://sunprinces.github.io/portfolio/publication/metaasr/","publishdate":"2021-06-26T14:01:37+08:00","relpermalink":"/portfolio/publication/metaasr/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we proposed to apply meta learning approach for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR). We formulated ASR for different languages as different tasks, and meta-learned the initialization parameters from many pretraining languages to achieve fast adaptation on unseen target language, via recently proposed model-agnostic meta learning algorithm (MAML). We evaluated the proposed approach using six languages as pretraining tasks and four languages as target tasks. Preliminary results showed that the proposed method, MetaASR, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multitask pretraining approach on all target languages with different combinations of pretraining languages. In addition, since MAML's model-agnostic property, this paper also opens new research direction of applying meta learning to more speech-related applications.","tags":["Meta-Learning","ASR","Multilingual","Seq2Seq"],"title":"Meta Learning for End-to-End Low-Resource Speech Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chia-Hsuan Lee","Hung-Yi Lee","Szu-Lin Wu","Chi-Liang Liu","Wei Fang","Jui-Yang Hsu","Bo-Hsiang Tseng"],"categories":["NLP"],"content":"","date":1555135304,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624693959,"objectID":"99f575e224189090e089d8af357fdab8","permalink":"https://sunprinces.github.io/portfolio/publication/qa-journal/","publishdate":"2021-06-26T14:01:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/portfolio/publication/qa-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"Although multimedia or spoken content presents more attractive information than plain text content, the former is more difficult to display on a screen and be selected by a user. As a result, for humans, accessing large collections of spoken content is much more difficult and time-consuming than doing so for text content. It would therefore be helpful to develop machines which understand spoken content. In this paper, we propose two new tasks for machine comprehension of spoken content. The first is a listening comprehension test for TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for English learners whose native languages are not English. We show that the proposed model outperforms the naive approaches and other neural network based models by exploiting the hierarchical structures of natural languages and the selective power of attention mechanism. For the second listening comprehension task – spoken SQuAD – we find that speech recognition errors severely impair machine comprehension; we propose the use of subword units to mitigate the impact of these errors.","tags":["QA"],"title":"Machine Comprehension of Spoken Content: TOEFL Listening Test and Spoken SQuAD","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

As a result, accessing large collections of the former is much more difficult and time-consuming than the latter for humans. It’s therefore highly attractive to develop machines which can automatically understand spoken content and summarize the key information for humans to browse over. In this endeavor, a new task of machine comprehension of spoken content was proposed recently. The initial goal was defined as the listening comprehension test of TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for English learners whose native languages are not English. An Attention-based Multi-hop Recurrent Neural Network (AMRNN) architecture was also proposed for this task, which considered only the sequential relationship within the speech utterances. In this paper, we propose a new Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM), which constructs multi-hopped attention mechanism over tree-structured rather than sequential representations for the utterances. Improved comprehension performance robust with respect to ASR errors were obtained.","tags":["QA","Attention-based Model"],"title":"Hierarchical Attention Model for Improved Machine Comprehension of Spoken Content","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
